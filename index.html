          <p>
          In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Overworld bosses are powerful enemies that can be encountered throughout the game’s open world, outside of main dungeons or story-related areas. These bosses are typically much stronger than regular enemies and have unique move sets, larger health pools, and often reward players with valuable items or materials upon defeat.

          <p>
          The largest monster to make its home in Hyrule, the Hinox lives primarily in forested areas. A keen awareness of your surroundings is paramount when facing one, as Hinox are known for tearing entire trees from the ground and using them as weapons.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/BVV88RF"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/MDDqqLQ/Bot-W-Hinox-Model.webp" alt="Bot-W-Hinox-Model" border="0"></a>
        <p>
           In this game, Hinoxes are found in red, blue, and black varieties, depending on strength. A red Hinox is the easiest to fight, a blue Hinox is moderately hard to fight, and finally, a black Hinox is the hardest to fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Link sneaks up on them,  he can steal the equipment from the necklace without being detected. Once they’re awaken, they will use physical attacks such as swipes and punches and pull up nearby trees in order to toss them at Link. If Link is able to climb out of their reach,  the lesser variants will throw small boulders at him, while Black Hinoxes use bomb barrels. Shooting an arrow at the eye will result in the monster being stunned and open to attacks until it recovers. After their health drops to half, they will begin to cover their eye to block arrow shots; however, there are still chances to hit it during some of their animations or by shooting while falling. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue and Black Hinoxes wear crude greaves made from wood and  metal (respectively) around their ankles to protect them from attack.  However, the armor can be used against them with the correct elemental attacks, the wood armor can be set on fire to make them panic until it burns away, and the metal armor conducts electricity and will subsequently stun them if hit by lightning-based attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once defeated, they will drop weapons (if they were not already stolen from their necklaces beforehand),  and some rewards such as Hinox Toenails, Hinox Teeth, and Hinox Guts. In addition, they will drop some food depending on the variety such as reds drop fruits, blues drop fish, and blacks drop meat.

      <section id="Talus" class="main-section">
        <header>Talus</header>
        <article>
          <p>
          Talus’ are typically camouflaged with the terrain, they appear as a group of rocks. If Link walks too loud nearby one or stands on the rocks,  it emerges from the ground and forms a giant, stone golem. The different variations of Talus can range from Stone, Luminous, Rare, Frost, Igneo, and a new variant added in Tears of the Kingdom is the Battle Talus. There are even smaller versions of Talus called Pebblit, these have their own variations like the Talus.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/XW1QH3w"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YNmCgyr/Bot-W-Stone-Talus-Model.png" alt="Bot-W-Stone-Talus-Model" border="0"></a>
        <p>
          They are very slow-moving, so as long as Link stays behind or beneath them, he will be out of harm's way. Taluses can use their large arm structures to punch and swipe across the  ground, dealing heavy damage to the impact area. They can also fall  forward and crash their entire body into the ground or launch large fragments of their rocky frame at Link.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taluses have three configurations:
        </p>
        <code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Low-elevation </b>- Taluses have an ore deposit on their back. It's easily accessed if you strafe the Talus and get it to spin but very hard if you're on the Talus when it gets up.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mid elevation </b>- Taluses have their ore deposits on their far left. To reach it, you can attack the Talus by using a spear while they're reforming their left shoulder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>High elevation </b>- Taluses have the ore deposit on their right shoulder, not as low as the low-elevation ones, but still not that high. it's  impossible to reach without climbing the Talus.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </code>
        <p>
          To defeat a Talus, Link can climb onto its body and time a ground-based strike correctly to attack the Ore Deposit on its back, usually located on top or the back. Link can inflict double damage using a two-handed Weapon, or four times as much damage using an Iron Sledgehammer. After taking damage, Taluses attempt to throw Link off by shaking themselves. To make climbing easier, Link can use a Flower Bomb to blast apart its arms, hindering it temporarily or use the Ascend to move through the Talus and appear on top. Taluses regenerate lost body parts shortly after losing them. If you can't climb onto it, stun it with a normal arrow, shooting the Ore Deposit on its back, making it fall on its face.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you encounter a Frost or Igneo Talus, you can’t simply climb on its back like the Stone or Luminous Talus. If you do attempted to climb onto it, you will either be froze and temporarily immobilized or set on fire. What you’ll have to do is use elemental arrows that are opposite of its Variation. If it’s a Frost Talus, use fire arrows, and if it’s a Igneo Talus, use ice arrows. By using the arrows on the body, it will fall down and give you an opening to climb on top. If you use the arrows on its arms, it will not be able to use its arms; however, it will be able to grow them back after a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new variant of Talus was added in the sequel, the Battle Talus, a modified Stone Talus to function as a mobile Monster Stronghold accompanied by three Bokoblin with wooden floors to prevent intruders from climbing on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          To defeat a Battle Talus, you usually fight them the same way as a Stone Talus, the only difference is that you can’t climb up as easily. You have to defeat the Bokoblin while the Talus either swipes or throws boulders at you. You can shoot the Bokoblins with arrows or ascend onto the fortress and kill them with your sword. Then finish the Battle Talus by using a blunt weapon to destroy the Ore Deposit on it’s back. Be cautious of it’s attempts to shake you off after a few attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon defeating a Talus, you can collect the Talus’ Heart, which can be fused with Link's current weapon, in addition to their usual drops of Gems.

        <article>
          <p>The Moldugas swim beneath the desert's sand. It spends most of its time submerged,  but if it senses sound, it will breach the surface to feast on whatever it can grab. If you feel the sand rumbling, it’s best to quickly get to land or higher ground so that the Molduga won’t be able to grab you. Don’t run around carelessly especially in a large dessert areas.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/kgQWvtw"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1f8wjkP/Bot-W-Molduga-Artwork.png" alt="Bot-W-Molduga-Artwork" border="0"></a>
        <p>
          Once they become aware of Link's presence, they will barrel towards Link and attempt to ram into him. Moldugas can be fought while Shield Surfing with the help of a Sand Seal. They are very sensitive to loud noises, so they can also be fought by having them eat a flower bomb when they rise out of the sand.
          </p>
          <code>If Link is especially quick, he can stun a Molduga as soon as its recovers. It's belly has a x1.2 damage modifier when hit.
            </code>
        <p>
          When defeated, a Molduga drops one or two Treasure Chests containing various weapons, Molduga Fins, and Molduga Guts.

      <section id="Frox" class="main-section">
        <header>Frox</header>
        <article>
          <p>
          The Frox has several Ore Deposits growing out of its back, much like a Stone Talus. There are also different variations of Frox like the Blue-White Frox and the Obsidian Frox. The strongest is the Blue-White Frox, then Obsidian Frox and finally the Frox. They are primarily found in large open spaces in the depths; each of these often has a small Zonaite Deposit. They walk around the area slowly when neutral, and can see and hear very far to detect any prey. The Frox tends to devour any Brightbloom Seeds they see or hear. Also, like the Talus, they have a smaller version called the Little Frox.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/qDfYYJ2"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/L0WddNs/Frox-Model.png" alt="Frox-Model" border="0"></a>
        <p>
          To defeat a Frox, Link must first stun it. He can do so by either shooting Arrows into its eye or throwing a bomb or take out the time bomb into its open mouth when it tries to suck him up. Be careful when gliding over the Frox as it is able to jump and knock you down. Once the Frox is  down, Link can climb onto its back and attack the rocky growths on its  back; a rock-crushing weapon makes this easier. When all rocks are destroyed, the monster dies and drops various items such as Zonaite, Frox Fang, Frox Fingernail, and Frox Guts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dazzle Fruit is especially effective against Frox. By throwing one at it, the Frox will be blinded by the sparkles, making it down for a even longer period.

        <article>
          <p>
          A Gleeok is a large, three-headed dragon-like enemy with different variations wielding elemental powers like fire (Flame Gleeok), ice (Frost Gleeok), or lightning (Thunder Gleeok), making them a formidable challenge due to their multiple attack points and varied elemental abilities; the most powerful Gleeok is the "King Gleeok" which combines all three elements.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/gwTxXYn"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/nfcFVpW/Gleeok-Model.png" alt="Gleeok-Model" border="0"></a>
        <p>
          They come in Flame, Frost and Thunder variants, all appearing as massive dragons with three heads with one eye each. They keep enemies from attacking at close-range by using gusts from the wings to force them back, allowing them to spray their array  of elemental attacks from afar at their leisure, and the occasional  tail-swipe on the ground. At lower health, they take to the skies to use more powerful blasts of elemental energy. Link can use arrows to target their eyes and send the Gleeok crashing back down to earth, allowing  him to close the distance for a follow-up assault. Fusing monster eyeballs to arrows, especially in tandem with a Duplex or Lynel Bow, is highly effective, as it allows Link to rapidly fire them upward with all but guaranteed accuracy towards the eyes.
        </p>
        <code>
          Superior versions known as "King Gleeoks" also debut, with each of their three heads channeling one of fire, ice and lightning. These are much more dangerous than their more common counterparts due to being able to wield a triple threat of elements.
        </code>
        <p>
          After they’re defeated, the Gleeoks tend to drop Gleeok wings, guts, and depending on their variation-elemental horns.

        <header>Flux Construct</header>
        <article>
        <p>
          It appears on floating sky islands and in The Depths. It is made of Zonai blocks that are connected together via Zonai magic. It is defeated by destroying its core, which glows green. They have  three different levels: I, II, III.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/Svm64kT"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/w6QdFnH/Flux-Construct-Model.png" alt="Flux-Construct-Model" border="0"></a>
        <h2>Flux Construct I</h2>
        <p>
          The first iteration of the Flux Construct is a beginner-level  overworld boss. It has two forms: Golem Form and Hover form. The Flux  construct starts off in its Golem form, capable of slamming down with  one or both hands. If faraway, the Flux construct can teleport to Link's position and proceed to slam with both their hands.
          </p>
          <p>
The weak point is its core. Their cores are usually on an exposed position such as their hands or on their feet, making it easier for  Link to strike it with melee weapons. Once it takes enough damage, the  cubes will scatter and leave the core vulnerable for a limited time before it reassembles.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reassembling, it will go into Hover form, a flattened  arrangement of cubes with its core on top. Its only attack is launching a series of cubes at Link, inflicting physics-based collision damage  based on the speed of the cubes. The hover form is usually at low  elevation and its core is often exposed underside for easier shot with  the bow. Like the golem form, if the cube takes enough damage from the bow, it  will scatter and become vulnerable. Once it regenerates it will return  to its Golem form and repeat the process until death (its or the  player's).
        </p>
        <h2>Flux Construct II</h2>
        <p>
          Flux Construct introduces a new form: Cube. A 3x3 dimensional cube  that will roll in an attempt to trample Link. It will roll at a steady  pace, but may sometimes speed up if Link is close by. Sometimes it may  jump and slam over to Link while rolling.
          </p>
          <p>
Along with its basic forms, there are a few distinct differences. The Golem form's core is primarily located behind the golem's torso for better protection, as well as its Hover form having a higher elevation  out of Link's reach. Finally, if you are directly between its legs in  Golem form, it will stand on its "heels" and stomp around. The filler  cubes in any form can be pulled out to clear a way for the core to be  struck.
To expose their core, it must be pulled out manually with the Ultrahand ability. Once the core has been pulled out, it will scatter and become vulnerable, exactly as level I.
If the core somehow falls off the arena, the cube will instantly regenerate and return to the fight area. Sometimes undefeated second models may have a treasure chest attached to them.
        </p>
        <h2>Flux Construct III</h2>
        <p>
          The third model has gold-colored trims around their cubes. The only  change from the second version is the Golem form will follow up its  single-handed slam with the teleport slam.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the third model has the ability to switch its core around to prevent it from being targeted. Every time the core is aimed at, it will shift around and repositioned  in a way where Link cannot shoot arrows at it (ie: behind their torso).  It will not shift to a more vulnerable position such as their arms or  legs in their Golem form. Along with its shifting ability, it also has  the ability to recover detached cubes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the second model, the core must be pulled out with Ultrahand to expose it. But due to its shifting ability, trying to grab the core  will cause the Ultrahand's grasp to almost disengage. To pull out the  shifting core, the construct must be stunned by shooting its core with a Bow. It  will continuously keep shifting when aimed at, but quick reflexes might  be able to make short work of it. Pulling the other cubes to expose the  core will make it easier to aim at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the second iteration, undefeated third models may have a treasure chest attached to them.

        <article>
          <p>
          The mere remains of what was once a giant monster known as a Hinox is known as a Stalnox.  These skeletal beasts appear at nighttime. Much like their living  counterparts, the Stalnox will tear entire trees from the ground to use as weapons. Furthermore, even if it appears defeated at first, it will keep coming back for more as long as its eye is left intact.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/NspYcRz"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Czv0RLF/Stalnox-Model.png" alt="Stalnox-Model" border="0"></a>
        <p>
          Like its living counterpart, the Stalnox pursues Link, attempting to pound him to the ground or catch him between its hands. It is also able to pick up trees to use as weapons. Uniquely to the Stalnox, it can remove its ribs, collarbone, and even an arm to throw at Link. It is  also able to dig up Bomb Barrels to hurl, which explode on contact. Shooting an Arrow into its eye will stun the boss as he hold it in pain, giving Link the chance to attack. However, when its health is past half, shooting the eye ball will detach it from its socket which will cause the Stalnox's body to drop into a pile of bones for a few moments. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, Link can attack the eyeball or even pick it up and throw it further away from the body, eventually, however, it will return to the Stalnox. Shooting the eyeball with a Bomb Arrow will automatically remove the eye no matter how much health the boss has. Once the eye has lost all of its health, or if the Stalnox and the eye are not reunited before the morning comes at 5:00am, the Stalnox is automatically defeated.
        </p>
        <code>
            Once dead, the Stalnox will drop Hinox Teeth and rare weapons.

        <article>
        <p>
          Gloom Spawn aka Gloom Hands seem to be monsters composed entirely of Gloom. They resemble large, corpse-like clawed hands, each one with a malice-looking eye on the palm. If Link is within a certain radius, they suddenly  spawn out of pools of concentrated Gloom, and will target Link on sight, relentlessly chasing him out of their territory if they do not catch him first. They will attack Link even if he's wearing the Majora's Mask.
        </p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/pfHpjGx"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fk37dB2/Gloom-Spawn.png" alt="Gloom-Spawn" border="0"></a>
        <p>
          Gloom Spawn move very quickly towards the player and will attack by picking Link up and squeezing him. This deals Gloom Damage, meaning it cannot be healed normally. Gloom Spawn also expand the Gloom they appeared from, with an area of Gloom following the Spawn around so that they always are sprouting from it.
Gloom Spawn can regenerate if there are any remaining in the group. They can also teleport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gloom Spawn are fast, dangerous and can swarm the player very easily. If Link is on the surface when they appear, the sky will turn dark red similar to during a Blood Moon. They cannot be outrun on foot; however, they can be avoided by climbing a vertical wall or pillar as they cannot climb. If they are avoided for long enough, they will leave behind two to three Dark Clumps. When a group of Gloom Spawn is defeated, a Phantom Ganon will appear on the spot where the last Gloom spawn died.

          Depending on its location, Phantom Ganon wields either the Gloom Club, Gloom Spear, or Gloom Sword, and all of them are equipped with Demon King's Bow. It attacks using these three weapons and can also teleport to in front  of Link if there is an inaccessible zone in between them and Link, if  they cannot, it'll use its bow. Also, if Link is on a platform that Phantom Ganon cannot get to, or has lose track on where Link is (hiding behind objects, using a Dazzlefruit) it can cover the floor and walls with gloom like it does in the Hyrule  Castle fight, it will continue spreading up to a certain radius and will cancel out of it once it spots Link again or takes damage.  Additionally, if Link stands too close to Gloom Club-wielding Phantom Ganons long enough after swinging their club, they'll kick Link. If Link attempts to repeatedly shoot arrows to Phantom Ganon's face rapidly enough, without using the bow airborne, sometimes the arrows won't damage it.

          Like Gloom Spawn, if Link flees far enough, Phantom Ganon will disappear and leaves behind Dark Clumps. This counts as a kill, meaning it won't return until the next Blood Moon.
